/**
  We cannot access functions on inherited contracts using the aragonAPI. Issue: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/issues/133
  For now though, we can copy the function signatures we wish to use from inherited contracts into the generated
  dist/artifact.json file into the Functions list at the bottom. dist/artifacts.json is generated after deployment.
  Only a refresh is required to give the aragonAPI/the UI access to the functions.
